![Effortless Labs — Interfaces for the autonomous age](https://github.com/effortlesslabs/docs/blob/main/images/effortlesslabs_hero.png?raw=true)


[Effortless Labs](https://effortlesslabs.xyz/) is a design-driven research and engineering studio.
Our work is user-centric, systems-focused, and long-term.

We build foundational technology by treating design and usability as first-class primitives —
from system architecture and data infrastructure
to interfaces, workflows, and real-world execution.

This GitHub Organization hosts Effortless Labs’ open source research, experiments, design systems,
and production-grade infrastructure.

Among other things, we are currently building:

[Hyperbola Network](https://hyperbola.network): A decision-native data infrastructure for autonomous systems  


[Igris Bot](https://igris.bot): An agent-driven, non-custodial execution engine for onchain operations  
  

[Realm App](https://realmapp.io) A personal knowledge and workflow system for saving, organizing, and recalling information effortlessly  
  

[Locus Graph](https://locusgraph.com) A context and memory graph system for structuring context, state, intent, and decision history  
  


* **Design Systems**: Interface and UX primitives for AI-native and crypto-native products

* **Infrastructure Tooling**: Internal libraries and systems for performance, reliability, and scale

You can find our research and writing at the Effortless Labs website.

Other projects and initiatives we support:
* Open-source agent tooling and execution frameworks
* Design systems for complex, high-stakes software
* Experimental infrastructure for autonomy, data, and coordination
